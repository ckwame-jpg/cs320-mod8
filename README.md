## CS-320 Reflection

Throughout this course, I strengthened my understanding of software testing and quality assurance. To ensure my software is functional and secure, I relied on unit testing using JUnit, followed by exception handling and input validation. Writing these tests gave me a clear view of how even small errors can ripple through the system if not caught early.

When interpreting user needs, I paid close attention to the assignment requirements and built my classes to align with expected behaviors. I made sure the methods provided straightforward ways for users or other systems to interact with the contact data, while still enforcing validation rules.

My design approach focused on simplicity and readability. I used private variables with public getters/setters and enforced strict validation in constructors and mutators. This kept the code clean and maintainable while also preventing bad data from creeping in.

Overall, these projects gave me a solid foundation in writing testable Java code and helped me see the importance of clean design and thorough testing in real-world software.
